# issue_template

This repository has a custom bug_report issue template: https://github.com/bigdogwillfeed/issue_template/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md (the customization is that issues with that template have specified labels)

If you open a new issue selecting "Bug Report" from [this page](https://github.com/bigdogwillfeed/issue_template/issues/new/choose), you get the labels as expected.

If you click [this link](https://github.com/bigdogwillfeed/issue_template/issues/new?template=bug_report.md), you get a new issue with the body from the template, but no labels

If you click [this link](https://github.com/bigdogwillfeed/issue_template/issues/new?template=bug_report.md&labels=invalid), you get a new issue with the body from the template, and the labels specified in the link
